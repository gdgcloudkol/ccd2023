Google Cloud provides a rich set of services as API e.g. Translation, Pub/Sub, Analytics etc., which can cater most of the distributed application needs with less or no effort. To invoke any API we need credentials; a common way is using static keys. Though using static keys is quick and easy, it adds lots of operational overhead. In this session let us explore what those are and how Workload Identity can help avoid those operational issues.",

While service meshes like Istio provide these capabilities via a user space proxy mechanism it's not always feasible to inject sidecars proxies for all your applications. On the other hand Kernel technologies like eBPF when used in a CNI like Cilium provides security and metrics transparently but lacks the richness of information and policy capabilities provided by a layer 7 proxy with strong identities. In this session, I will present how we can leverage capabilities provided by both these technologies and achieve better security and observability ensuring all your applications can have uniform policy and visibility irrespective of whether they are in the mesh or not or if they are running as a container in Kubernetes or long running VM where making privileged changes are often not possible.",

We will conclude by discussing some cons of XLA and some edge cases. If you are an ML Practitioner that cares about delivering optimized ML models improving their latency and throughput trade-offs, this session is for you :)",
