Now, the technology is adopted by the masses and has become a de-facto standard for any cloud-native application. The open-source system provides management, deployment, and scaling of your containers. Kubernetes is hard to beat in orchestration, but one of the most significant drawbacks is its lack of reproducibility. \r\n\r\n\r\nHere comes Helm: A package manager for Kubernetes and a CNCF Graduate Project. But how will you get started with Helm? The answer is by clearing the basics. This talk will help describe the importance of Helm in the current landscape and give you details on the why and how Helm is used.\r\n\r\n",

But given the growth in cloud machine-learning computing, which deals with extremely valuable data, and companies need to be paying particular attention to handling that data securely. The operation and maintenance of large scale production machine learning systems has uncovered new challenges which have required fundamentally different approaches to that of traditional software. The area of security in MLOps has seen a rise in attention as machine learning infrastructure expands to further critical use cases across industry. In this talk, we will discuss the key security challenges that arise in production machine learning systems, best practices and frameworks that can be adopted to help mitigate security risks in ML models, ML pipelines and ML services reinforcing SecOps into MLOps.",

                "description": "Over the past few years, lots of organizations have started to adopt Cloud Native architectures. Despite the adoption of Cloud Native architectures many companies haven’t achieved optimal results. Wondering why? One of  the reasons is our adherence to traditional ways of building and deploying applications.\r\n\r\nKubernetes has become the de facto Cloud Native deployment platform. It offers radically easy scaling and fault tolerance. Despite this, not many CI systems utilize the benefits of kubernetes. None of the existing build system offers the capabilities that are native to Kubernetes like in-cluster building, defining the build resources using CRDs, leveraging underlying security and access control etc., These missing features of Kubernetes made the Cloud Native architectures to be less effective and more complex.\r\n\r\nIn this session we will explore an Open Source project Drone --  a cloud native self-service Continuous Integration platform -- . Though 10 years old, Drone offers a mature, Kubernetes based CI system harnessing the scaling and fault tolerance characteristics of Cloud Native architectures. The session will also explore the characteristics of Drone; Simplicity, Cloud Native, Decoupled and Declarative with a demo that will show how to define drone pipelines to do a self-service continuous integration, facilitating quicker builds and faster deployments to cloud native platforms like Kubernetes.\r\n",

While we are often excited about the solutions that can solve world’s biggest problems, maintaining those applications once they are out there serving the customers remains ignored and becomes a bottleneck in growth.\r\nIn this session we will be talking about the importance of monitoring applications in production that are serving the customer traffic and how tools can be used to log errors and record metrics that are critical to troubleshoot any big issue. We will also go through the tools provided by Google Cloud Operations, viz., Cloud Logging, Cloud Monitoring and Error Reporting and the ways in which these can be leveraged to monitor your own services to save yourself from being the next big news of Is it Down?",

This talk is suitable even for audience with little or no idea about UI/UX personalization as we'd start from the very basics. This talk also covers a service of Firebase called 'Remote Config', and for that a basic understanding of what Firebase is and how to setup firebase is required. A couple of end-to-end working demos of personalizartion using remote config would also be included in form of videos, as coding live during the event wouldn't be possible.",

The session will be a deep dive into the insights that the dataset offers. \r\n\r\nWhat's in it for the audience - Learn how to turn variables into actionable information. \r\nSay, 30% of the total registrations did not provide a GitHub profile. \r\nIf one had provided their GitHub profile, it directly implies that one is more aware than at least 30% of the applicants. A simple insight such as this will help them gauge where they stand with respect to their competition. \r\n\r\nWhat's in it for the organizers - The same insight informs the organizers that 30% of applicants did not even know about GitHub. Having such action points can enable them to understand the needs of the community even better and cater to them. ",
